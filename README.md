# tello-drone
Playing around with Tello drones and deep learning.

## Objective
Train a deep neural network to track a specific individual via facial recognition.

## Steps
1. Think about the system structure
2. Code the skeleton of the system including: connecting/configuring the drone; the model as a black box (input: image, output: bounding box); control based on detections and drone state
3. Train a low-latency model on a few images (find a suitable SAM-like labelling tool)
4. Code, code, code (and evaluate)
5. Test in real life
